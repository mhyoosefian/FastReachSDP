# Reach-SDP
Reach-SDP was developed in [1] to compute a tight reachable set for dynamical systems in feedback with neural network controllers. This repository contains the code for it. Unlike the original code provided the authors of the original paper, this code is not just developed for the double integrator or the quadrotor. It works for any dynamical system in feedback with ReLU neural network with any number and size of hidden layers.
